      <p>Hello everybody! Something I really like to do is to spend time with my family,</p>
          I like to play piano and compouse songs.I've been member of the Church of Jesus Christ
          of Latter Day Saints sense I was 8 , I've growth with the teaching of the gospel of 
          Jesus Christ and that is something of what I am so grateful with the Lord. My favorite scripture 
          is 2 Nephi chapter 2 verse 25: "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy."</p>

          <p>I see many advantages when learning web design, companies always need to publish their image and 
             they do it through web pages, another thing that draws my attention to this area is that I can
             learn and show a lot of creativity, I think that is what I like most about ,web design.</p>
